# Setting Up Laravel on a LAMP Stack

This guide is meant for assisting me in setting up Laravel, mostly on my development machine and in testing environments. You can do whatever you want with it. Obviously if you are deploying a laravel app to production, you may need a more serious take on the security aspect of the endeavor.

Currently this guide uses the following technologies:

- apache2 
- **if you don't like apache and would rather use 
nginx ~~because you're a hipster~~, one of the articles 
below actually uses that)**
- mysql (I just like mysql more 
than mariadb as a slight personal preference, but I'm sure 
you could use that too) 
- php 7.2 
- composer 
- Laravel 5.8 
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

I'll do my best to update this repo accordingly as newer versions of the above technologies are released.
